## What to Expect

Throughout the year, weâ€™ll explore a wide range of topics in cyber security. The workshops are designed to equip you with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills that can be applied to Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions and real-world job applications.

Our goal is to help you build your skills step-by-step, progressing from foundational concepts to advanced techniques.

## Workshop Overview

The year is divided into four focused categories:

### Foundations

Start with the basics! These workshops aim to build a foundation in reverse engineering, binary exploitation, web security, and cryptography. Whether you're analyzing binaries, finding vulnerabilities in web applications, or learning to exploit vulnerabilities, this category prepares you for more advanced topics and introduces fundamental tools and techniques.

### Vulnerabilities and Exploits

Dive deeper into offensive security! These workshops focus on exploiting vulnerabilities in binaries, web applications, and networks. Learn advanced tools and techniques to understand and craft exploits.

### Secure Development and Defensive Techniques

Dive deeper into defensive security! Learn how to write secure code, identify vulnerabilities, and implement protective measures against attacks.

### Incident Response and Forensics

Learn how to detect and respond to security incidents! These workshops focus on analyzing digital evidence, investigating breaches, and recovering valuable information through forensics.
